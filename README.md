Welcome to WebDev101! 🎉

This repository is my playground for diving deep into the world of web development. Currently, I’m taking Jonas Schmedtmann’s amazing “Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS” course on Udemy, and I’m using this repo to document my progress, share my projects, and experiment with new skills.

From mastering HTML5 & CSS3 fundamentals to building responsive and visually stunning websites, this journey is all about growth, creativity, and having fun! 🌟

Feel free to explore, fork, and follow along as I learn and create. Let’s build something awesome together! 🙌
